This is an Android app for finding best exchange rates in Belarus. Available
on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fobo66.exchangecourcesbelarus)

App allows to quickly load the best exchange rates in the big cities of Belarus. By clicking on list
item users can find nearest bank offices with best rates on the map. By long pressing on the
currency card users can copy currency rate to clipboard, e.g. for pasting into the calculator.
**Please pay attention that info about exchange rates may be out of date. Please clarify in banks.**

This is a small project of mine aimed to be the polygon for the newest and shiniest stuff in
Android. It features 100% Kotlin, Hilt, coroutines, Clean Architecture, Room, AndroidX Benchmark and
unit tests. Any contributions are welcome.

It was my first Android app that I've started in 2015, but I've changed repos in the wrong way, and
a lot of git history is missing. Plus there were a lot of refactorings, so this is not an app it was
back in 2015. It wasn't public because it was quite ugly and it had leaked signing keys in git.
